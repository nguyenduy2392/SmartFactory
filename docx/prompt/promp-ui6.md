Ensure backward compatibility with existing UI.

Rules:
- Existing screens must continue to work without new inputs.
- Any additional backend data should be optional.
- Do not break existing API contracts.
- If UI does not consume new fields, ignore safely.

Priority:
- UI stability > feature completeness.
