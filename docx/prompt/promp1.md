You are working inside an existing system with existing UI screens.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT redesign UI.
- Do NOT remove or rename existing screens.
- Do NOT change existing user flows.
- Only ADD backend logic, validation, and database structures if missing.
- If a screen already exists, adapt business logic to fit the screen, not the other way around.
- If a field already exists in UI, reuse it.
- If a required business field does not exist in UI, derive it automatically in backend.

PHASE 1 SCOPE ONLY:
- Processing PO Import
- Process BOM Configuration
- Availability Check

OUT OF SCOPE:
- Production planning
- Production execution
- Tool usage tracking
- Cost variance
